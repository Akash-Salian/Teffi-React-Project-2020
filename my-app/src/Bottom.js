      Teffi is based on the Pomodoro timer technique, a time management
      method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. The
      technique uses a timer to break down work into intervals,
      traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. Each
      interval is known as a pomodoro, from the Italian word for 'tomato',
      after the tomato-shaped kitchen timer that Cirillo used as a
      university student.

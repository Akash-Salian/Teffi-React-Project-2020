      Teffi a.k.a Time Efficiency, is based on the Pomodoro timer technique, a time management
      method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. <br/><br/>The
      technique uses a timer to break down work into intervals,
      traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks either of 5 minutes or 10 minutes. Each
      interval is known as a pomodoro, from the Italian word for 'tomato',
      after the tomato-shaped kitchen timer that Cirillo used as a
      university student.

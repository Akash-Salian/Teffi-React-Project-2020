Teffi is a simple pomodoro web-app designed to help students focus on their studies. You can choose 3 or more session of 25 minutes with 5 minutes break in between sessions. After that you can take a 10 minute break and start another large session. Regular breaks between sessions have proven to create memory chunks and help retain information effectively. Results may vary from individuals and their medical conditions. Note: Teffi doesn't take any responsibility for students not getting good grades after using our app. The app is designed for the general public who would like to improve their attention and focus during study sessions. 

Features:
• Control Pomodoro, Short Breaks and Long Breaks with interactive buttons.
• Start and stop the timer by clicking on the Timer itself.
• Control timer using the start, stop and reset button.
• Sound Toggle button can control background music for both break sessions and if needed on the Pomodoro session by click twice.
• Background music is very soothing and can be used for relaxing or meditating during break sessions.
